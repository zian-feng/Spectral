# Time Series & Spectral Analysis: Design, Simulation, and Interpretation
> This project explores the simulation, visualization, and interpretation of synthetic time series data, with emphasis on spectral analysis techniques.
> Key topics include:


1. **Time Series Simulations & First-Level Analysis** – Construction, simulation, visualization, and comparison of time series data.
2. **Fourier Analysis** – Understanding Fourier transformations, periodograms, and methods for removing noise and trends.
3. **Wiener-Khinchin Theorem & Power Spectral Density** – Deriving power spectra and exploring signal-to-noise ratios.
4. **Filter Design** – Implementation of low-pass, high-pass, and band-pass filters.
5. **Cross-Spectral Analysis** – Modifications and examination of cross-power spectra, coherence, and complex coherency spectra.
